    <p>Looks like we hit a snag. Don't worry, the internet is just playing hard to get.</p>
    <p>Our team of highly trained monkeys (or maybe just really tired humans) is fixing it.</p>
    <p>In the meantime, you can <a href="/">go back home</a> or try again later.</p>
    <p>And remember: <em>Errors happen. It's not your fault!</em></p>
